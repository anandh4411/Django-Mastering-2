# <-- PART 1 - REST APIs -->

1. What is RESTful API?
    * it's an interface for client apps (frontend) to access data
    * API has different endpoints for performing different tasks
    * eg: endpoint to add product, delete product, update orders etc.
    * client app sent request to this endpoint
    * our API endpoint sends a response back.

    * What makes an API RESTFUL?
    * Representational State Transfer (REST)
    * There are some rules for servers and clients to communicate over internet
    * those APIs who confirms to this rule is called RESTful API
    * The main 3 concepts are -> Resources, Representations, HTTP Methods.

2. Resources
    * are some objects eg: products, collections, orders etc
    * client apps can access them using a url (uniform resource locator)
    * eg: https://anandh.xyz/reviews/1

3. Resource Representations
    * when a client request for a resource eg: product
    * we need represent that resource in a format and give it to the client
    * it may be in html, xml (old), json (modern) format
    * server side representation is different
    * in django, we represent a resourse as a model or a class
    * but when we send that resource to a client, we makes it a json or other format
    * # we uses json the most (javascript object notation)
    * # they are key value pairs and keys will be strings ""
    * {
        "name" : "Anandh",
        "age" : 21
      }

4. HTTP Methods
    * get -> get resource
    * post -> create resource
    * put -> update resource
    * patch -> for updating part of it (like subset of properties)
    * delete -> delete resource
    
    * eg: while creating product, we sends a post request to api endpoint
    * in body of the request we should have a json object with product details
    
    * eg: while updating all properties of product -> put request with id
    * eg: while updating only some properties of product -> patch request with id
    * url: /products/1

    * for deleting, we just need the id which is included in the url
    * no body is required
